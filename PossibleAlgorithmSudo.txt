initialize a data structure to contain the sub categories (buckets)

initialize the list of images

while the list is not empty:

	grab first image and run imagenet on it
	create new bucket with first image and its labels

	for each image:
		run the next image on imagenet
		
		if image labels match current bucket:
			add the image with it labels to the bucket
			remove the image from the list
			
			
This algorithm is O(n^k) where n is the number of images and k is the amount of sub categories that will produced.
We predict k to be within 3-10 making the algorithm not as expensive as n^n which would be a case where non of the images are similar.
