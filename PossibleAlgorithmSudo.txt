initialize a data structure to contain the sub categories (buckets)

initialize the list of images

while the list is not empty:

	grab first image and run imagenet on it
	create new bucket with first image and its labels

	for each image:
		run the next image on imagenet
		
		if image labels match current bucket:
			add the image with it labels to the bucket
			remove the image from the list
			
			
This algorithm is O(n^n) because the worst case scenario is that none of the images will match.
However since we are using images that are related it shouldn't be the case.
First loop shouldn't have to go through more than 3-6 times because we are expecting high match rates.
